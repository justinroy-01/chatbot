## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed on your system.

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine.
git clone <https://github.com/justinroy-01/chatbot>
cd mybot

### **Step 2: Dependencies**
npm install @google/generative-ai react-markdown
(Note: If other dependencies from package.json are not installed, you may need to run npm install first.)


### **Step 3: Get Your Gemini API Key**
You need a Google Gemini API key to use the chatbot. You can get one for free from the Google AI Studio.

Go to Google AI Studio.

Click the "Create API key in new project" button and copy your new key.

### **Step 4: Set Up Your Environment File**
In the root directory of the project (mybot/), create a new file named .env.

Open the .env file and add your API key in the following format. The REACT_APP_ prefix is crucial for it to work with Create React App.

File: mybot/.env
